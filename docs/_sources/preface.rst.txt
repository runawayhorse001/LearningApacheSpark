About this note
---------------

This is a shared repository for `Learning Apache Spark Notes`_. 
The PDF version can be downloaded from `HERE <pyspark.pdf>`_. 
The first version was posted on Github in `ChenFeng`_ ([Feng2017]_).  
This shared repository mainly contains the self-learning and 
self-teaching notes from Wenqiang during his `IMA Data Science
Fellowship`_. The reader is referred to the repository
https://github.com/runawayhorse001/LearningApacheSpark for more
details about the ``dataset`` and the ``.ipynb`` files. 

In this repository, I try to use the detailed demo code and 
examples to show how to use each main functions. If you find 
your work wasn’t cited in this note, please feel free to let
me know.

Although I am by no means an data mining programming and Big Data expert, 
I decided that it would be useful for me to share what I learned 
about PySpark programming in the form of easy tutorials with 
detailed example. I hope those tutorials will be a valuable tool 
for your studies.

The tutorials assume that the reader has a preliminary knowledge 
of programming and Linux. And this document is generated automatically
by using `sphinx`_.

* **Biography**

  Wenqiang Feng is the Director of Data Science at American Express (AMEX). Prior to his time at AMEX, Dr. Feng was a
  Sr. Data Scientist in Machine Learning Lab, H&R Block. Before joining Block, Dr. Feng was a Data Scientist at Applied
  Analytics Group, DST (now SS&C). Dr. Feng’s responsibilities include providing clients with access to cutting-edge
  skills and technologies, including Big Data analytic solutions, advanced analytic and data enhancement techniques
  and modeling.

  Dr. Feng has deep analytic expertise in data mining, analytic systems, machine learning algorithms,
  business intelligence, and applying Big Data tools to strategically solve industry problems in a
  cross-functional business. Before joining DST, Dr. Feng was an IMA Data Science Fellow
  at The Institute for Mathematics and its Applications (IMA) at the University of Minnesota.
  While there, he helped startup companies make marketing decisions based on deep predictive analytics.

  Dr. Feng graduated from University of Tennessee, Knoxville, with Ph.D. in Computational Mathematics
  and Master’s degree in Statistics. He also holds Master’s degree in Computational Mathematics from
  Missouri University of Science and Technology (MST) and Master’s degree in Applied Mathematics from
  the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).

Motivation for this tutorial 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I was motivated by the `IMA Data Science Fellowship`_ 
project to learn PySpark. After that I was impressed and attracted by the
PySpark. And I foud that:

 #. It is no exaggeration to say that Spark is the most powerful
    Bigdata tool.
 #. However, I still found that learning Spark was a difficult
    process. I have to Google it and identify which one is true. 
    And it was hard to find detailed examples which I can easily
    learned the full process in one file. 
 #. Good sources are expensive for a graduate student.

Acknowledgement
+++++++++++++++

At here, I would like to thank Ming Chen, Jian Sun and Zhongbo Li at the 
University of Tennessee at Knoxville for the valuable discussion
and thank the generous anonymous authors for providing the detailed
solutions and source code on the internet. Without those help, 
this repository would not have been possible to be made. Wenqiang 
also would like to thank the `Institute for Mathematics and Its 
Applications (IMA)`_ at `University of Minnesota, Twin Cities`_ 
for support during his IMA Data Scientist Fellow visit and thank TAN THIAM HUAT and 
Mark Rabins for finding the typos. 


A special thank you goes to `Dr. Haiping Lu`_, Lecturer in Machine Learning 
at Department of Computer Science, University of Sheffield, for recommending 
and heavily using my tutorial in his teaching class and for the valuable 
suggestions. 


Feedback and suggestions
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Your comments and suggestions are highly appreciated. I am more
than happy to receive corrections, suggestions or feedbacks through
email (von198@gmail.com) for improvements.
